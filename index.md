**Will Code For Beer** is a social event hosted by Visma at offices spread around the globe.
Bring your colleagues to collaborate in solving entertaining programming problems in return for delicious beer!

> An excellent way to challenge your brain, and at the same time have a great time with your colleagues. Even though it's a competition, people like to help each other to get the best experience

- Jesper Plantener, Chief Architect at Visma Enterprise DK

> Will code for beer, var et virkelig hyggeligt 'gå-hjem' arrangement. Det er en sjov måde at socialisere med sine kollegaer på, samtidig med at man bliver lidt fagligt udfordret med de opgaver man skulle løse. Jeg glæder mig allerede til næste gang.

- Anna Hansen, AI Engineer at Visma Dinero

> Good stuff!

> I loved the atmosphere. It's was nice to see people concentrate as much as they did, because it's a sign of interest and fun. It was also great to see that the amount of participants has generally quadrupled. The only complaint I might have is that the difficulty level of the problems could have been more varied, so that people from different backgrounds can participate. But even that, I feel, is an unfair complaint, since the high difficulty level also made the whole event more challenging (read: "more fun") and highly educational. I will definitely come back next time, hopefully with much better skills!

The problems are constructed to be attractive for newcomers, the atmosphere is extremely relaxed, and participants are encouraged to help each other with problem solving, debugging, or basic programming language or computer issues.
A facilitator will be available at the event and eager to help at all times during the event.
The focus is on problem solving, social interaction within and among teams, programming, confidence-building, and fun.

Unlike many similar events, **Will Code For Beer** is not a competition---there are no prizes to win and there is no awards ceremony.

Who is this for?
----------------

The event should be entertaining and meaningful for programmers at every skill level: 
Even if you have zero confidence in your own programming ability, we promise that you’ll get at least one problem done.
On the other hand, the harder problems should be enough to keep experienced programmers busy.
Don’t expect to solve all problems; aim at two or three.

Next event
----------

**Will Code For Beer 2022** is planned for November 2022.

### Call for facilitators

Please send me an e-mail at mikkel.andersen@visma.com if you would like to help facilitate the event at your local Visma office!

(No) Preparation
----------------

No formal preparation is required, you can show up at the last minute.
However:

* It’s more fun if you find some colleagues to team up with.
* Bring your laptop, and bring a pen and paper for collaborative thinking and problem solving
* If you’ve never done something like this before and want to get a feeling for the type of problems appearing at the event, you can try to solve some easy problems on Open Kattis, such as [Hello World!](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello), [Baby Bites](https://open.kattis.com/problems/babybites), or maybe even the WCFD 2019 problem [Drinking Song](https://open.kattis.com/problems/drinkingsong).
This is particularly useful for learning how to read and write input and output. But don’t stress out over this beforehand – we’ll help during the event.

Details
-------

Here’s how to have the most fun:

* Bring your own laptop, which must be able to connect to the wireless network, for instance via eduroam.
* One free beverage per solved problem per person.
* Some twenty different programming languages are accepted, including Java, Python, JavaScript, and various C dialects. 
  See the [Kattis language overview](https://open.kattis.com/help) for the full list.
* No prior registration is required. Create your team at [Insert contest Link]
* After your team solves a problem (and having it accepted on the server), you will be allowed a delicious beer.

Previous events
---------------

* Friday, 12 November 2021, 16-19. _Will Code for Beer 2021_ took place in the Copenhagen Visma Office. The problems were at [https://visma-wcfb22.kattis.com/contests/vy4ghe](https://visma-wcfb22.kattis.com/contests/vy4ghe).
* The contest is based on Will Code for Drinks, and the problem setters were Troels Bjerre Lund, Thore Husfeldt (chair), Christian Janos Lebeda, Oskar Haarklou Veileborg, and Johan Sannemo. WCFD 2021 enjoyed social, financial, and/or moral support of the computer science departments at IT University of Copenhagen and Aarhus University, ScrollBar and Datalogisk Fredagscafé, the BARC Centre for Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen, Alessandro Bruni, and Kattis.
* We owe them a big thanks for setting previous events up!
